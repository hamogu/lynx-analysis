    "# Ray-tracing the Lynx XGS\n",
    "\n",
    "[Lynx](https://www.lynxobservatory.com/) is one of the four large surveyors that NASA looked at through detailed science and technical studies in preparation for the 2020 Decadal survey. In the Design Reference Mission (DRM) Lynx has a diffraction grating for high-resolution spectrocopy of soft X-rays. The science requirements for this instrument are a spectral resolving power $R > 5000$ and an effective area $A_{\\mathrm{eff}} > 4000$ cm$^2$ at 0.6 keV. Such a spectrometer could be build with either reflection or transmission gratings. The DRM baselines critical angle transmission (CAT) gratings. On these pages, I present ray-traces for performance and trades for the CAT XGS. Most of the content is published in the following literature references, but the results presented here have been updated with respect to that and include additional material, such as more detailed plots and interactive 3D models of the instrument:\n",

    "## Lynx XGS: How does is look?\n",
    "In this section, I show how the XGS setup looks. I start with an interactive 3D view, which can be zoomed and rotated with the mouse in all supported browsers; pressing \"r\" returns the view to the initial position. See [the X3DOM documentation](https://www.x3dom.org/documentation/interaction/) for a full list of supported mouse and keyboard commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rays start in the aperture, which is shaped like a series of concentrig rings. The exact dimensions of the mirror, in particular the position of support spiders etc. are somewhat arbitrary at this point, since the mirror design is still nominal and will be refined at a later stage in the development. In the Lynx mirrors, photons will bounce twice in a Wolter-Schwarzschild geometry. However, in this simulation the mirror is simplified such that the reflection actually happens in a single plane, shown in white (the the double refelction is taken into account when calcualting the survoval probability of a photon).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Rays are imaged onto detectors (yellow). The color of the rays is according to their diffraction order. Since this is a monoenergetic simualtion, the orders are well separated."
