    "First, we look at a zeroth order image. That allows us to check that we got the mirror right. This simulation uses a simplified mirror model. It does not simulate individual mirror shells, but instead is treats the mirror as a continuum. Every photon hitting the mirror plane is redicted to the focal point assuming an \"ideal\" mirror. Then, additional scatter is added both in the plane of reflection and out of the plane of reflection. Typically, for an individual shell, the scatter is larger in the plane of reflection due to figure errors and the scattering by particulates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we want to simulate a mirror where the PSF is domianted by the mis-pointing of individual mirror shells (which is the case where sub-aperturing is the least useful). Mis-pointing of the shells happens in both x and y direction, which, looking at a single photon, can be simulated by assuming a perfect mirror and scatter of the same magnitude in the plane of the scattering and out of the plane of the scattering. \n",
    "Note that for simulations of gratings it would be cheating to apply a blur in the focal plane to account for the PSF in the way that many simpler simulations programs do it, because we need to know the direction of the photon already when it hits the gratings, and not just in the focal plane."

This optimized for the spectral focus, i.e. it makes the orders narrow in dispersion direction, but at the cost of a wider distribution in the cross-dispersion direction. Only for the zeroth order (red, leftmost dot) do the imaging focus and the spectral focus agree and thus this order is circular as shown in the plot above. For CAT gratings, it is useful to use a *tilted* Rowland torus, which intersects the focal plane a second time, thus there is a second place (around 700 mm for the parameters chosen here) where the dispersed order is small in dispersion and cross-dispersion direction. This leads the fish-shaped distribution seen in the plot above. We now look at one of those orders in more detail."

    "The left plot shows the arrangement of the grating facets looking from end of the mirrors towards the focal plane. The dispersion direction is from left to right and cross-dispersion from top to bottom. There is no special meaning in that gap at the middle right. It's just where I started distributing the grating facets. The gap is just too small to place another set of facets so it's left empty. The distribution of facets can be improved to reduce the uncovered area in between, but that this stage it is not useful to spend to much detailed work on that. Note that the coloring schme is different than in the 3D view on the interactive 3d website. Facets are colored according to the angle that the facet center has towards the positive dispersion direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot on the right shows a spefic grating order on the detector (order 7). The detector is cylindrical following the Rowland circle. Intersection positions with this detecor are the projected on the focal plane so that I can properly display them in a two-dimensional plot. Individual photons are colored according to the grating facet that they passed through. There are several things we can learn from this plot: First, note that the x and y axis are not to scale, this really is much longer in cross-dispersion direction (top to bottom) and narrow in the dispersion direction (left to right). Second, the aboslute position along the dispersion direction is 75 cm from the focal point, so the dispersion angle is about 5 deg - significantly more than in Chandra or XMM-Newton. Thus, abberations that do not need to be considered for Chandra or XMM-Newton can be important here. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we can now look at the distribution of colors and we see immediately that the distribution is not homogeneous. Photons that went through the cyan, green, and yellow colored gratings are distributed a narrower than the blue and red points. Thus, sub-aperturing *can* defintely increase the spectral resolving power. However, the pattern of the sub-aperturing is completely different than the \"normal\" pattern. Typically, sub-aperturing is done using only an area along the cross-dispersion direction (here the orange and light blue gratings). In contrast, here, we achieve the best spectral resolving power by using only gratings that are located along the forward dispersion direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be a surprising result at first glance, but thinking back to the assumptions that went into this simulation, it might seem a little more sensible. We set up the PSF such that there is no difference between in-plane and out-of-plane scatter and thus there is nothing special about the cross-dispersion direction. Instead the shape of the PSF is dominated by other things. Now, recall that this order is located about 75 cm from the optical axis; at the same time the facets go from -60 cm (red and blue) to +60 cm (light green). There is a consideralbe path length difference between those photons. The light green facets are located essentially \"directly above\" the order, while the red/blue ones are 1.5 m to the side; so it should not come a a complete surprise that the abberations differ between those two groups.\n",

    "The plot above shows the PSF for different grating orders and energies. The energy for each row is listed on the left, and then the PSF is shown for order 0, -1, -2 ,... from left to right. THe x-axis in eahc panel has a differnet scaling and shows the position in dispersion direction (in mm) measured from the optical axis. Dots are colored according to the angle of the facet that the photon went through using the same color scale as above. For each order, the y axis is scaled differently. As shown in the fish-shaped plot above, the width in the y direction ranges from 0.02 mm for order 0 to a a few mm for higher orders. Using a the same scaling in y direction for all orders in a row would hide several of the details for the PSFs I'm going to discuss now, but keep in mind that the scaling of x and y axis is not the same. For exmaple, all zeroth orders are really circular and not elliptical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know highlight a few insteresting aspects about the use of subaperturing for different energies and orders. This discussion here is qualitatively and I try to explain why things look the way they do and later I will show the actual number for the resolving power. Looking at the zeroth order for any energy, all the colors are well mixed in the plot and sub-aperturing will not do anything to change that. This is simply the result of our setup, where the scattering of the mirror is the same in every direction. At 0.3 keV most of the photons are found in order -3 and -4. In both cases, we see that sub-aperturing as discussed in detail above (selecting the angles for cyan, green, and yellow) would significantly narrow the order and thus improve the spectral resolving power. It is interesting to note that the color scheme seems flipped between order -3 and -4. In order -3 the blue-ish photons are found on the top and the reddish photons at the bottom, in order -4 that is reversed. The Rowland torus optimizes the focussing in the dispersion direction, but the focus in the cross-dispersion direction is different. In one case the detector is located below the focus in cross-dispersion direction (so in y direction photons have passed through the focus and spread out again), in the other case it is above the cross-dispersion focus. This flip happens around 62 cm, where the 7 order of 0.6 keV photons is located. Photons of higher energy (and thus lower wavelength) are not dispersed this far out and thus there is no flip in the plots for 1.0, 1.4, and 1.8 keV.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for higher energies where the grating orders are located closer to the optical axis, the distribution of the photons in each order depends less on the angle of the facet that they went through and thus sub-aperturing cannot do much to improve the spectral resolving power. The simulations for 1.4 and 1.8 keV photons show this. At these energies, the efficiency also peaks at much lower orders and the relevant signal is only a few cm from the optical axis (for example, order -2 for 1.8 keV is at 59 mm = 5.9 cm. \n",
    "\n",
    "At 1 keV, a significant number of photons are seen in very low orders (-1 to -3) where sub-aperturing is not relevant, but then again there are many photons in order -9. If Lynx uses sub-aperturing, then one could analyze the photons in order 9 for high-resolution work, if instead a larger number of photons is required for the science goal, but spectral resolving power is not crucial, then the observer could include the lower orders in the analysis. However, for simplicity, I will just average the resolving power for all orders when I show plots of resolving power vs sub-aperturing angle below.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to point out one more feature: While the signal of the cyan, green, and yellow photons is generally is approximately centered on the same position as the wider distribution for the red and blue photons, this is not the case around 40-50 cm from the optical axis (order -2 for 0.3 keV; order -5 for 0.6 keV; order -9 for 1 keV).\n"
