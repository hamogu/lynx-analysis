    "\n",
    "The purpose for this document is to lay out the mathematical formulas and the numerical values chosen for the Rowland tori in the Lynx CATXGS. It describes some of the motivations and derivation to arrive at these numbers, but that description is not necessarily sufficient to derive a unique solution. Tables for parameters for the Rowland torus and examples how to derive positions and orientations for CAT gratings and detectors that are placed on these tori are given."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lynx concept provides high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy coupled with unprecedented effective area. Incoming X-rays are focused using a mirror designed for half-arcsecond spatial resolution. The area under the mirror shells can be covered by critical angle transmission (CAT) gratings which disperse the light onto a strip of detectors. These gratings can swing in and out of the beam. In order to achieve the best possible spectral resolving power at all detected grating orders, the CAT gratings need to be mounted on the surface of a torus, called the Rowland-torus. (Note that the gratings are not tangential to the torus. Their orientation is discussed in detail below.) At the same time, the detectors are tangential to the \"other side\" of the same torus. We first discuss the traditional Rowland torus design as it is employed in e.g. the Chandra/HETGS and then detail the modifications for the Lynx CATXGS, where the axis of the torus is tilted with respect to the optical axis."

    "## The traditional torus geometry\n",
    "In the nineteenth century, spectroscopists realized that a flat grating with constant grating period requires collimated light with parallel plane waves to realize the full resolving power of the spectrograph. To avoid aberations for incoming light that is focused onto a point, either the grating period has to be variable or the grating needs to be curved. One possible solution is to curve the grating on a the surface of a circle and place a curved detector on the other side of the circle. This arrangement is called the \"Rowland circle geometry\" and can be extended to three dimensions as a \"Rowland torus\". See [Paerels, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11214-010-9719-y) for a discussion of this concept and [Beuermann et al., 1978](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978ApOpt..17.2304B) for a formal derivation. In practice, several simplifications are done for Rowland spectrometers in X-ray observatories. Instead of a single, large, curved grating many small gratings are mounted such that their centers match the surface of the torus. Similarly, although these finite gratings deviate from the surface of the torus, they typically have a constant grating period, making the manufacturing process much simpler. For gratings that are just a few cm on each side, the resulting error is typically much less than that caused by the PSF of the telescope. One example of a modern Rowland geometry X-ray spectrometer is the High-energy-transmission grating spectrometer(HETGS) on Chandra, see [Canizares et al., 2005](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005PASP..117.1144C).\n"

    "## Equations to describe a torus\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different ways to describe a torus mathematically. Different expressions have different advantages and disadvantages for particular use cases. For example, the parametric torus equation lends itself well to triangulate the surface of the torus for visualization, but the quartic form is more useful to numerically solve for the intersection points between the torus and a ray in ray-tracing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the following conventions: $r$ determines the radius of the Rowland\n",
    "circle, $R$ is the distance from the center of the circle to the symmetry axis of the torus. If $r < R$, the torus has an inner hole like a doughnut, and if $r > R$ the inner parts of the torus overlap with each other (called a \"spindle torus\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### The torus\n",
    "The following quartic equation describes a torus where the y-axis is the symmetry axis. The roots of this equation are the (x,y,z) coordinates of points on the surface of the torus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + R^2 - r^2)^2 = 4 R^2 (x^2 + z^2)\\ \\ .(1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation becomes very unwieldy if the symmetry axis does not coincide with one of the axes of the coordinate system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to express coordinates is to parameterize them by two angles, $\\theta$, which describes points on the Rowland circle with radius $r$, and $\\varphi$, which rotates this circle around the axis of symmetry:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\\\ \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}(R + r \\cos{\\theta}) \\cos\\varphi\\\\\n",
    "r \\sin\\theta\\\\(R + r \\cos{\\theta}) \\sin\\varphi\\\\ \\end{pmatrix}\\ \\ (2)$$"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Unlike the quartic given before, this equation can be generalized with reasonable effort to tori where the center $\\vec c$ does not coincide with the origin of the coordinate system and the axis of symmetry is not parallel to one of the axes of the coordinate system. The axis of symmetry is given by a unit vector $\\vec e_y$. We define a vector $\\vec e_R(\\varphi) = \\vec e_x \\cos\\varphi + \\vec e_z \\sin\\varphi\\ $  and can now write a generalized torus equation for points $\\vec p$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec p(\\varphi, \\theta) = \\vec c + R \\; \\vec e_R(\\varphi) + r \\; (\\vec e_y \\sin \\theta + \\vec e_R(\\varphi) \\cos \\theta)\\ \\ . (3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a torus that is translated and rotated with respect to the coordinate system, we only need to rotate the $\\vec e_x$, $\\vec e_y$, and $\\vec e_z$ and specify $\\vec c$. The table below will do just that. Alternatively, the points on the torus can be calculated using the original coordinate system using either equation (1) or (2) and then be transformed into the new coordinate system. "

    "### Homogeneous coordinates\n",
    "We write coordinate transformations in [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates). This is a well known concept in geometry and computer vision and described in standard textbooks. In short, points and vectors (x,y,z) are written in homogeneous coordinates as ($x_h$, $y_h$, $z_h$, $w_h$). $w_h$ is a kind of scale factor. For a point in 3-d space $x = x_h / w_h$, $y = y_h / w_h$, and $z = z_h / w_h$. Vectors in 3-d space (directions) are expressed as points at infinity, i.e. $w_h = 0$. The advantage of homogeneous coordinates is that the transformation between two coordinate systems can be written as a simple $4\\times 4$ matrix, which contains both translations and rotations and that multiple coordinate transformations can be chained by just multiplying their transformation matrices together. Below, we give the transformation matrices to transform our canonical torus (origin at (0, 0, 0) and y-axis as symmetry axis) into the Rowland torus for the Lynx CATXGS."

    "In the meantime, we adopt the following definitions: The origin of our coordinate system is at the nominal focal point the the mirror. The $x$-axis coincides with the optical axis, such that astronomical sources are located at $x=+\\infty$. The positive $y$-axis is the direction of dispersion."

The sketch on the left shows a cut through the Rowland torus and labels certain points and distances. The gray box on the side marks the position of the mirror. The focal point is located at the origin of the coordinate system. The drawing shows a cut through the $z=0$ plane, which also contains the symmetry axis of the torus. This gives two circles of radius $r$ shown in blue. For the parameters chosen for the Lynx CATXGS, those two circles overlap. The dotted lines are intended to help visualize the position of the torus. We chose $\\alpha$ to be the blaze angle to make the blazed grating facets close to tangential to the Rowland Torus ([Heilmann et al., 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.856482)). \n",

    "\n",
    "The equations of the Rowland torus tell us *where* to place the CAT gratings, but not which *orientation* they should have. For now, let us assume that we place the center of the grating exactly on the Rowland torus. Since the grating is flat, that means that most of the grating surface is either above or below the Rowland torus. Naively, one might think that a better place would be to move the grating slightly inward, but this is not as simple as it sounds, because usually the gratings are not tangential to the Rowland torus, but have a different orientation, which we will now explain.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a Rowland geometry with traditional transmission gratings the grating surface shall be perpendicular to the incoming rays. The exact impact of other orientations on the performance of the instrument can be simulated with ray-trace simulations. The most important effects typically are a drop in grating efficiency (and thus the effective area) for non-normal incidence and a decrease in spectral resolution when the the grating bars are not perpendicular to the intended dispersion direction.\n",
    "Thus, we want the surface normal vector for a grating at position $\\vec p$ to be $$\\vec n = \\frac{\\vec p}{|\\vec p|}$$ because all rays point to the focal point, which is located at the origin of the coordinate system. We note that the position directly on the optical axis is the only position where the direction $\\vec n$ is also normal to the surface of the Rowland torus. In general, $\\vec n$ is tilted with respect to the torus surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifying the normal to the surface still leaves one degree of freedom: rotation around the normal $\\vec n$. We fix this by requiring that the direction of the grating bars $\\vec e_\\mathrm{bar}$ is perpendicular to the diffraction direction, which is $\\vec e_y$ in our coordinate system: $$\\vec e_\\mathrm{bar} \\cdot \\vec e_y = \\vec 0\\ \\ .$$"

Optimizing the exact placement to capture as much signal as possible is done elsewhere, here we only list the position of the Rowland torus, or more precisely the Rowland circle. The dispersed signal forms a line starting from the optical axis, thus detectors do not need to cover a 2-d space on the Rowland torus, but just a single line with $\\theta = 0$ in eqn (2) or (3), effectively reducing the 3-d Rowland torus to a 2-d Rowland circle.
